# Scrabble Scorer

A program that accepts user input in the form of a word and returns a Scrabble score relative to one of three scoring algorithms.

- The first algorithm, "Scrabble" awards points relative to the letter's rarity.
- The second algorithm, "Simple Score" awards one point for every letter.
- The third algorithm, "Bonus Vowels" awards three points for vowels, one point for consonants.

_This program was a homework assignment at LaunchCode's Lc101 (2019)_
